# This Weeks Summary

This week a learned:
  - Create a Repo
  - Publish my Repo
  - Link to my GitHub Desktop

The Steps I took to complete the assignment was taking it slow, step by step. Code is very precise. If you miss one small step, it will take some time to fix your issue. I had to go back and reread the steps a couple times.

Yes, I had some issues, but it was me mainly trying to work to fast. I found that I was missing some important steps in the process.

I learned that this class is going to be a challenge, but I am excited to learn it!

I wasn't able to help any of my fellow classmates out this week.
